# World Beyond

## | Project Overview
World Beyond is an add-on overhaul of Minecraft. Made by and for the members of the Bedrock Add-Ons Discord Server, the extension builds upon existing Vanilla, base-game concepts, expanding them with thoughtful and professional quality. Fight monsters, meet cute (and scary!) new critters, and explore infinitely in this brand-new and vibrant world!
